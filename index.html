         <li class="lineh">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
         <li class="lineh">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
         <li class="lineh"><span class="line">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="yellow1">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

    <h2 class="red"><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul class="purple">
        <li class="spacing">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements. </li>
        <li class="spacing">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li class="spacing">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li class="spacing">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="yellow1">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>   
    </ul>
    <p class="bold">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applied a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p class="bold">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
    <p class="bold">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
